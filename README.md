## About this proyect

It is the first complete website i made, a law firm.
It's a final proyect for a web development course i did.


## What did I do?

- At first i had to make it with only html and css
- Later, redesign it using Sass, Bootstrap (library) and Animate.css (library)
- I made it responsive

It was hard back then, I plan to remake it eventually :)
